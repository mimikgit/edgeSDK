2. Click on the "Add a new app" tab to register your app
3. Provided the required information to add your app

- **App Name**: This field is shown to end users when they registered as a  end user for the application. This info  also indicated in the dialogue box while getting access grants from end users.
- **Website URI**: web URI of the application developer or enterprise company. It should start with protocol address such as "http://mimik.com"
- **Redirect URI**: Redirect URLs are a critical part of the OAuth flow. After a user successfully authorizes an application, the authorization server will redirect the user back to the application with either an authorization code or access token in the URL. Because the redirect URL will contain sensitive information, it is critical that the service doesnâ€™t redirect the user to arbitrary locations.
- **App Type**: Indicates that application type as "web" or native. The redirected URI should  be configured accordingly. The Developer Portal follows OAuth specifications. You can find detailed information about defining URI info based on the app type in the [OAuth redirect URI specification ](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/redirect-uris) . Please also note that web app should use "App Secret" which is generated when application added in Developer Portal
