## Objectives

This guide covers how to install and deploy the mDrive microservice to the edgeSDK runtime. The mimik team created this microservice for mimik access to enabled a file streaming use case with the following functionality:

1. Create a catalog of content on the edge device

2. Allow other devices to discover and stream the share content when the devices are connected to each other via account, link local WiFi, or proximity clusters.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Community Edition](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download) for your target development platform(s)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) v5.7.1
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) v 8.9.4
- edgeSDK is installed on your target development platform and and associated to your developer account

Download the latest release of the mDrive microservice. This guide will start from the Downloads folder.

## Instructions

```cd ~/Downloads```

```https://github.com/mimikgit/mDrive/releases/latest```

Extract the pacakge

```tar xvzf drive-v1.tar.gz```

Copy the mDrive tar file to your edgeSDK installation directory

```sudo cp -a drive-v1.tar /opt/mimik/edge/microservices/mDrive/```

## Start edgeSDK

In new terminal window, change from current directory to opt/mimik/edge

```cd /opt/mimik/edge```

Start edgeSDK

```./edge```

## Run mDrive microservice

Navigate to the where the drive-v1.tar file

```cd /opt/mimik/edge/microservices/mDrive/```

Install the drive-v1.tar image using the following command. **Note:*-Replace 'yourAccessTokenHere' with the "access_token" object created during account association for your target platform.

```curl -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer yourAccessTokenHere' -F  "image=@drive-v1.tar" http://localhost:8083/mcm/v1/images```

Initialize drive microservice

```curl -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer yourAccessTokenHere' -d '{"name": "drive-v1", "image": "drive-v1", "env": {"drive": "http://127.0.0.1:8083/drive/v1","MCM.BASE_API_PATH": "/drive/v1", "MCM.WEBSOCKET_SUPPORT": "false", "MFD": "https://mfd.mimik360.com/mFD/v1", "MPO": "https://mpo.mimik360.com/mPO/v1", "uMDS": "http://127.0.0.1:8083/mds/v1"} }' http://localhost:8083/mcm/v1/containers```

Verify that mDrive microservice registered and works properly by calling following curl commands:

```curl -i http://localhost:8083/drive/v1/files``
