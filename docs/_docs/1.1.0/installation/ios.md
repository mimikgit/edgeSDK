This guide assumes that:

- You are running iOS 11.0+

First download the iOS edgeSDK Cocoapod from our [Github Repository(https://github.com/mimikgit/cocoaPodEdge)]

To install it, simply add the following lines to your Podfile:

```source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'```

```source 'https://github.com/mimikgit/cocoaPodSpecEdge.git'```

```pod 'edgeSDK-iOS', '0.0.56'```

## Account association

Use the [account association](/docs/1.1.0/getting-started/account-association.html) guide link your Developer Account to your edgeSDK allowing you to discover and make calls to devices belonging to the account cluster 

Download the example application  [PC example app](https://github.com/mimikgit/edgeSDK/tree/master/example/PC%20Hello%20App) and use the [documentation](/docs/1.1.0/example-apps/how-to-run-edgesdk-example-app-on-linux-ubuntu.html)  for a quick end to end demo of this process.
