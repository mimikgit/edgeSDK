The mimik edgeSDK provides a light container management technology that allows developers to manage their microservices and enable communication of microservices within and across networks and nodes. Also included are sample applications and microservices to demonstrate the interactions with the APIs.

## Getting Started

First start by creating a [mimik Developer Account](/docs/1.1.0/getting-started/creating-a-developer-account.html). The Developer Portal is where you manage your the appID and SECRETS which are required for your application to access different aspects of the mimik platform.

## Installation

Select a platform from the list below and follow the instructions to learn: how to run the edgeSDK, how to build and deploy microservices, and how to run an example application using the edgeSDK and microservices.

- [Android 5.0+](/docs/1.1.0/installation/android.html)
- [iOS 9.0+](/docs/1.1.0/installation/ios.html)
- [Linux - Ubuntu 16.04 LTS](/docs/1.1.0/installation/linux-ubuntu.html)
- [Linux - Debian](/docs/1.1.0/installation/linux-debian.html)
- [Raspberry Pi - Raspbian 8.1](/docs/1.1.0/installation/raspberry-pi.html)
- [mac OS El Capitan+](/docs/1.1.0/installation/macos.html)
- [Windows 10](/docs/1.1.0/installation/windows.html)

## Account Association

All applications must register their account key provided by the Developer Portal in order to [associate their account](/docs/1.1.0/getting-started/account-association.html) with the edgeSDK. The [example Android](/docs/1.1.0/example-apps/how-to-run-edgesdk-example-app-on-android.html), [iOS](/docs/1.1.0/example-apps/how-to-run-edgesdk-example-app-on-ios.html), and [PC applications](/docs/1.1.0/example-apps/how-to-run-edgesdk-example-app-on-linux-ubuntu.html) allow you to quickly test this process.

## Microservices

To show case the capabilities of the edgeSDK we have created a few microservices as examples in how to develop a microservice on our environment.

- Our [Example](/docs/1.1.0/microservices/how-to-deploy-example-microservice.html) microservice helps develoeprs understand how to deploy a microservice to the edgeSDK runtime and call different methods for node and cluster discovery.
- [mBeam](/docs/1.1.0/microservices/how-to-deploy-mbeam-microservice.html) beams content from a node to node(s) and/or to service(s), peer-to-peer, one-to-one or one-to-many
- [mDrive](/docs/1.1.0/microservices/how-to-deploy-mdrive-microservice.html) abstracts access to storage available on edge nodes and provides distributed file management via a popular API.
- [mSuperdrive](/docs/1.1.0/microservices/how-to-deploy-msuperdrive-microservice.html) provides the core logic of [mimik access](#access) media services through the provided API well as showing all nodes (nearby, on the same Wi-Fi, remote and also friend’s ) that are equipped with [mimik access](#access).

Build your own microservice using the edgeSDK JavaScript programming API for develop and deploy their microservices.
